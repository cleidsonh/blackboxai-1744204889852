# AI Automation Platform

## Project Overview

The **AI Automation Platform** is a multi-platform AI automation system designed specifically for social media. It allows users to automate interactions and perform tasks seamlessly across multiple social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp, leveraging the power of artificial intelligence for enhanced user engagement and operational efficiency.

## Features

- **Multiple Platform Support**: Integrates with popular social media networks like Facebook and WhatsApp.
- **Database Connectivity**: Uses Sequelize ORM for database operations.
- **AI Capabilities**: Automates tasks using AI algorithms for enhanced functionality.
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Utilizes Axios for making HTTP requests efficiently.
- **Web Scraping**: Employs Puppeteer for browser automation and web scraping tasks.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-automation-platform.git
   cd ai-automation-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure necessary environment variables, such as database connection details.

4. **Run the application**:
   For development mode, use:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   For production mode, use:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints for Facebook and WhatsApp through:

- **Facebook API**: 
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/facebook
  ```

- **WhatsApp API**: 
  ```
  http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp
  ```

You can use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to these endpoints and interact with the platform.
